# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Data Synchronization and Conflict Resolution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system for keeping data in sync across platforms and resolving conflicts.
# Details:
1. Create a SyncManager class for handling data synchronization
2. Implement versioning for synchronized data
3. Develop conflict detection mechanisms
4. Create a ConflictResolver component for user-assisted resolution
5. Implement automatic conflict resolution strategies
6. Develop a changelog for tracking synchronization activities
7. Create a manual sync trigger for user-initiated syncs
8. Implement differential sync to minimize data transfer
9. Develop a recovery mechanism for interrupted syncs
10. Create analytics for sync performance and conflict frequency

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test SyncManager and related functions
2. Test conflict detection with mock conflicting data
3. Verify automatic and manual conflict resolution
4. Test interrupted syncs and recovery process
5. Verify differential sync with large datasets
6. Perform stress testing of synchronization process
7. Test analytics and reporting of sync activities
