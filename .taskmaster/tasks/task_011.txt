# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop Batch Processing and Scheduling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality for batch processing of migration tasks and scheduled migrations.
# Details:
1. Create a BatchProcessor class for managing multiple migration tasks
2. Implement a task queue system (use bull for Redis-based queue)
3. Develop a scheduler for future migrations (use node-schedule)
4. Create a BatchStatus component for monitoring multiple batches
5. Implement parallel processing with configurable concurrency
6. Develop a mechanism for pausing and resuming batch operations
7. Create a priority system for batch tasks
8. Implement batch-level error handling and reporting
9. Develop a cleanup routine for completed batches
10. Create analytics for batch performance and optimization

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test BatchProcessor and related components
2. Test scheduling of future migrations
3. Verify parallel processing with different concurrency levels
4. Test pause, resume, and cancellation of batch operations
5. Verify error handling at the batch level
6. Perform stress testing with large batch sizes
7. Test analytics and reporting functions
