# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Performance and Scalability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement optimizations to improve application performance and scalability.
# Details:
1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading (use React.lazy and Suspense)
2. Optimize React rendering with memoization (use React.memo and useMemo)
3. Implement server-side rendering for improved initial load (use Next.js)
4. Optimize images with WebP format and lazy loading
5. Implement caching strategies (use workbox for service workers)
6. Optimize database queries and indexing
7. Implement horizontal scaling for the backend (use Docker and Kubernetes)
8. Optimize API responses with compression (use compression middleware)
9. Implement CDN for static asset delivery
10. Develop a performance monitoring system (use Prometheus and Grafana)

# Test Strategy:
1. Conduct performance profiling of the application
2. Measure and compare load times before and after optimizations
3. Perform load testing to verify scalability improvements
4. Test the application performance on various devices and network conditions
5. Verify that optimizations don't introduce new bugs
6. Conduct user experience testing to ensure optimizations improve overall UX
7. Monitor performance metrics in production environment
