# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Error Handling and Retry Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a robust error handling system with automatic retry for failed operations.
# Details:
1. Create an ErrorContext using React Context API
2. Implement global error boundary component (use react-error-boundary)
3. Develop custom error classes for different types of errors
4. Implement automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff (use async-retry library)
5. Create an ErrorLog component to display and manage errors
6. Implement error reporting to a backend service (e.g., Sentry)
7. Develop user-friendly error messages and suggestions
8. Create a manual retry option for failed tasks
9. Implement error aggregation for batch operations
10. Develop a system for error analytics and reporting

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test error handling components and functions
2. Simulate various error scenarios and verify correct handling
3. Test retry mechanism with mock failed requests
4. Verify error reporting to backend services
5. Test user interface for error display and management
6. Perform usability testing of error messages and suggestions
